## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (30 seconds)

> "I'm Vikramaditya Singh. I built my foundation analyzing DNA mutations at Northwestern, 
> then applied those same systems-thinking principles to AI and product leadership.

## 📱 LINKEDIN "ABOUT" SECTION

### **Opening (Hook)**
```
From analyzing DNA with Perl scripts at Northwestern to building $5.6B AI-powered 
enterprise platforms — my journey isn't conventional, but that's exactly why it works.
```

### **The Unique Combination**
```
🧬 Scientific Rigor (Northwestern MS Biotechnology)
→ Hypothesis-driven thinking, evidence-based validation

⚖️ Business Judgment (Ivey MBA)
→ Strategy, trade-offs, stakeholder alignment

🤖 AI Systems Thinking (MS Computer Science, AI Thesis)
→ AI embedded across discovery, delivery, and learning
```

### **Proof Points**
```
Led teams at:
• Ontario Government (AI-powered vital events transformation)
• First American via TheoremOne ($5.6B title insurance platform)
• TELUS (Data4Good - HPE Privacy Innovation Award)
• Grainger ($170M revenue through NLP search optimization)
• State Farm (Enterprise API platform modernization)
```

### **The Differentiator**
```
Most PMs understand strategy OR execution.
Most understand AI tools OR business value.

I bring scientific thinking + strategic judgment + AI fluency.
That's what complex, regulated, high-stakes environments need.
